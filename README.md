Having trouble finding a movie to watch? Step into our time machine and see what was trending around the time (more accurately, the date and year) you were born!

This is the first project of the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. The goal is to use everything we've learned so far (plus a couple minor extras) to build something meaningful.

## Tech stack

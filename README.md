Having trouble finding a movie to watch? Step into our time machine and see what was trending around the time (more accurately, the date and year) you were born!

This is the first project of the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. The goal is to use everything we've learned so far (plus a couple minor extras) to build something meaningful.

## Tech stack

-  Vanilla JavaScript
-  [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
-  [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/)
-  [Watchmode API](https://api.watchmode.com/)

## Demo

TBA

## Potential improvements

-  using a paid API or scraping IMDb would've let us search movies without a specific text query (in-app, we only search movies with the word "the" in the title)
-  we can possibly filter movies by rating based on the user's birth year (don't recommend rated R movies to 12-year-olds)
